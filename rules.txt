Create the chessboard in 8x8 grid
(columns:a b c d e f g h, rows:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
create 16 pieces for each player the game (black and white):
- 1 king
- 1 queen
- 2 rooks
- 2 knights
- 2 bishops
- 8 pawns
game starts as follows:

  [rook knight bishop queen king bishop knight rook]
  [pawn pawn pawn pawn pawn pawn pawn pawn]
  [                                       ]
  [                                       ]
  [                                       ]
  [                                       ]
  [pawn pawn pawn pawn pawn pawn pawn pawn]
  [rook knight bishop queen king bishop knight rook]

-- rook movement
The rook can only move vertically or horizontally. He can't jump over other pieces in his path. If the square on the end of his move contains opponent's 
piece then this piece is taken. NOTE that the square where rook ends his move may not contain a piece of the same player

-- bishop movement
The bishop moves only in straight diagonal line and may also not jump over opponent's pieces

-- queen movement
The quene has combined movement of rook and bishop it means that she can only move in straight diagonal lines as well as horizontal and vertical lines

-- knight movement
The knight moves 2 steps in vertical or horizontal direction and 1 step in vertical direction if his first 2 steps were horizontal or 1 step horizontal 

-- pawn movement
The pawn moves 1 square straight forward, if it didn't move at all pawn can move 2 squares forward. When taking other piece pawn can move 1 upward square diagonally 

-- king movement
The king moves 1 square vertically, horizontally and diagonally though there's a special type of move called castling made by king and rook 

:SPECIAL RULES:

-- en-passant
when a pawn makes a double step from the second row to the fourth row, and there is an enemy pawn on an adjacent square on the fourth row,
then this enemy pawn in the next move may move diagonally
to the square that was passed over by the double-stepping pawn, which is on the third row. 
In this same move, the double-stepping pawn is taken. This taking en-passant must be done directly:
if the player who could take en-passant does not do this in the first move after the double step, this pawn cannot be taken anymore by an en-passant move.

-- pawns that reach last row
If pawn reaches the last row player can promote it to queen, rook, knight, or bishop (of the same color). 

-- castling
Under special conditions king and rook can move simultaneously:
* The king that makes the castling move has not yet moved in the game.
* The rook that makes the castling move has not yet moved in the game.
* The king is not in check.
* The king does not move over a square that is attacked by an enemy piece during the castling move, i.e., when castling, there may not be an enemy piece that can move (in case of pawns: by diagonal movement) to a square that is moved over by the king.
* The king does not move to a square that is attacked by an enemy piece during the castling move, i.e., you may not castle and end the move with the king in check.
* All squares between the rook and king before the castling move are empty.
* The King and rook must occupy the same rank (or row).

-- check
When the king of a player can be taken by a piece of the opponent, one says that the king is in check. 
For instance, the white player moves his rook to a position such that it attacks the black king, i.e., 
if black doesn't do anything about it, the rook could take the black king in the next move: 
we say that the white rook gives check. It is considered good manners to say check when one checks ones opponent.

-- mate
When a player is in check, and he cannot make a move such that after the move, the king is not in check, then he is mated. 
The player that is mated lost the game, and the player that mated him won the game.

Note that there are three different possible ways to remove a check:

*Move the king away to a square where he is not in check.
*Take the piece that gives the check.
*(In case of a check, given by a rook, bishop or queen: ) move a piece between the checking piece and the king.

-- stalemate
When a player cannot make any legal move, but he is not in check, then the player is said to be stalemated. In a case of a stalemate, the game is a draw.
